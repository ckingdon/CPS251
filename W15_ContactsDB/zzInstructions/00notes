One of the trickiest parts of this assignment is getting the garbage can
click to work. The problem comes in when you need to have an event on
the recycleview adapter that must pass information to the main  fragment.
This is done using an interface and this is something I want you to work out.

The posting I used to help figure it out is located here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52829707/how-to-pass-or-send-data-from-recyclerview-adapter-to-fragment/52830847#52830847.

I suggest you get everything else working and do this part last.
