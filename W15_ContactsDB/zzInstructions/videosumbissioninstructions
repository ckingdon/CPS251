For this project, you are to provide a short screencast showing how the project works. You can use either Screen Cast-O-Matic or any other screen recording software that creates an MP4 file.

You are to upload an MP4 file of your screencast to Blackboard.

You do not need to say anything just show it working. I want to see it displayed in landscape and portrait.

You are to provide a link to where this project is located in your Github account.
